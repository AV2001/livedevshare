# Live Dev Share Extension for VS Code

Easily share your local development server with others in real-time using ngrok tunneling.

## Features

-   Start an ngrok tunnel with a single click.
-   Automatically open the generated ngrok URL in your default browser.
-   Share your live development work with anyone, anywhere.

## Usage

1. Install the Live Dev Share extension from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.
2. Once installed, you'll see a new `Start Live Share` icon in the status bar at the bottom right of your VS Code window.
3. Click the icon to start sharing your local server. You'll be prompted to enter the port number your local server is running on.
4. After entering the port number, ngrok will create a secure tunnel to your local server, and the ngrok URL will be displayed.
